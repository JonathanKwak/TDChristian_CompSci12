; Hi Mr. Sawczak. I'm going to break the big news to you
; I don't program using Python or Java or C# of that matter, I use a variant of Lua called Luau
; It's used in the game ROBLOX, and mainly used on its creation engine known as ROBLOX Studio
; This is the part where I am most proficient in - I have spent well over 6 years familiarizing myself with the API and learning all the ins and outs of the engine.
; If needed, I can send videos of my games and works, but here I am going to deposit some pieces of code proving my familiarity with programming.
